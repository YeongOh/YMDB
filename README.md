# Movie Search App

## Motivation

I have been looking for project ideas for a while and I stumbled across the github repo [App Ideas Github](https://github.com/florinpop17/app-ideas/blob/master/Projects/3-Advanced/Movie-App.md) and decided to build it.

## User Stories

- [ ] User can see all the latest movie on the front page
- [ ] User scroll down to see all other movies according to release date
- [ ] User can click on any of the movie to go to their own separate page
- [ ] User can then see all about the movie ratings, about, actors present on each separate movie page
- [ ] User can create their own watch list

## Additional Features in mind

- [ ] Slider of Movies at Home
- [ ] Pagination or Infinite Scrolling
- [ ] Skeleton Screens
- [ ] Lazy Loading
- [ ] Multi word search separated by a comma or a white-space

## Framework and Libraries used

- Vite
- React Router
- React Query
- Fontawesome
- Axios

## Design

- I have always been a big fan of minimalistic design. I designed layout, buttons, search bars after [Youtube](https://youtube.com/) and [Watchapedia](https://pedia.watcha.com/).

## What I Learned

### Building small components first

- In my previous projects, I always built navbar first, but without knowing what features and links are going to be in the final project, it was not reasonable. It often ended with frustrations because I would spend a lot of time building shells, not features. When it became time to implement features, I was already exhausted. This time, I focused on building components with full features first, then I put them together. By implementing small features in the beginning, I felt like I was actually getting work done and progressing fast.
